# Black-hole-simulation-using-python
Non-spinning black hole simulation based on geodesic equation.
This program takes an equirectangular image and returns the image distorded by the black hole.
The Results can be saved in form of matrices to call them later.
An offset system can be used to simulate a moving background by saving a series of simulations with different offset.
